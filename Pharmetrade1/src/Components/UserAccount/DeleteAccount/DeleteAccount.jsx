          As per the GDPR Law we have added the feature so you can delete your account with personal 
          information any time. Please Note, The Account is not restorable so the action you perform 
          can not be undone or restored later. This Action will delete your account from our website 
          completely. You newsletter subscription will be unsubscribed too automatically.
